# Google Cloud Platform - Ingestion & Store Theory

## Why choosing a cloud architecture like GCP ?

- __scalable infrastructure__: you can "rent" more computation if you need it, and it's nearly instantaneous

- __pay-as-you-go pricing__: you only pay for the services you use. No upfront costs. No termination fees.

- __Serverless__: you can go from prototyping to production on a global scale, without worrying about data centers' main issues like physical installation, capacity, reliability, or performance.

- __Advanced analytics__: provides tools for big data analysis and storage

- __Future-proof technologies__: you can use the latest softwares which are constantly updated to the latest version available on the market

## The four steps of the data lifecycle in GCP

The data lifecycle has four steps.

1. __Ingest__: The first stage is to pull in the raw data, such as streaming data from devices, on-premises batch data, app logs, or mobile-app user events and analytics.

2. __Store__: After the data has been retrieved, it needs to be stored in a format that is durable and can be easily accessed.

3. __Process and analyze__: In this stage, the data is transformed from raw form into actionable information.

4. __Explore and visualize__: The final stage is to convert the results of the analysis into a format that is easy to draw insights from and to share with colleagues and peers.

## STEP 1: Ingestion

There are several approaches you can take to collect raw data, based on the dataâ€™s size, source, and latency.

- __App data__: Data from app events, such as log files or user events, is typically collected in a push model, where the app calls an API to send the data to storage.<br>

- __Streaming__: The data consists of a continuous stream of small, asynchronous messages.

- __Batch__: Large amounts of data are stored in a set of files that are transferred to storage in bulk.

![GCP data lifecycle](./imgs/theory/ingestion.svg)

### 1.A App data
Apps and services generate a significant amount of data. This includes data such as app _event logs_, _clickstream data_, social network _interactions_, and e-commerce _transactions_. Collecting and analyzing this event-driven data can reveal user trends and provide valuable business insights.

[__Cloud Logging__](https://cloud.google.com/logging) is a centralized __log-management service__ that collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others. You can __export__ data collected by Cloud Logging by using built-in tools that send the data to [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub), and [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

<ins>Examples</ins>:


- ___Writing data to a file___: An app outputs batch CSV files to the object store of [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).
- ___Writing data to a database___: An app writes data to the managed MySQL of [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) or the NoSQL databases of [Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore) and [Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable).
- ___Streaming data as messages___: An app streams data to [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/), a real-time messaging service.


### 1.B Streaming Data

Streaming data is delivered asynchronously, without expecting a reply, and the individual messages are small in size. Streaming data can be used for firing event triggers, performing complex session analysis, and as input for machine learning tasks. CGP offers [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) as a tool for managing streams of data.

<ins>Examples of Streaming data</ins>

- ___Telemetry data___ from Internet of Things (IoT) network-connected devices
- ___User events___ from Apps logging events (e.g., when the user opens the app and whenever an error or crash occurs)

<ins>GCP offers</ins>

- [__BigQuery Streaming Inserts__](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery): stream your data into BigQuery one record at a time
- [__Cloud Pub/Sub__](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/): Real-time messaging

<br>

#### BigQuery Streaming Inserts

stream your data into BigQuery one record at a time

Streamed data is available for real-time analysis within a few seconds of the first streaming insertion into a table.

It is indeed extraordinary for a DWH to accept Streaming Inserts, but be aware of the [quota limits](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#streaming_inserts). They are high, but there are limits.

  - Maximum row size: 5 MB
  - HTTP request size limit: 10 MB
  - Maximum rows per second: 500,000 rows per second, per project located in `US` or `EU`
  - Maximum rows per request: 10,000 rows per request (be aware of per-request latency - too few vs too many rows)
  - Maximum bytes per second: 1 GB per second, applied project level.

Also, no at least once semantics. Make sure you understand how to [ensure data consistency](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery#dataconsistency)

<br>

#### Cloud Pub/Sub

Ingest event streams from anywhere, at any scale, for simple, reliable, real-time stream analytics

- At-least-once delivery at any scale
    - Synchronous, cross-zone message replication
    - per-message receipt tracking

    - open REST/HTTP and RPC service APIs for pulling and pushing messages
    - open-source [Apache Kafka connectors](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsub/tree/master/kafka-connector) to send and receive messages
    - [JMS connector](https://www.striim.com/integrations/jms-google-cloud-pub-sub/)
- Global by default with consistent latency
    - Publish from anywhere in the world
    - consume from anywhere
    - No replication necessary
- Compliance & security
    - fine-grained access controls
    - end-to-end encryption
- Pricing for [Seek-related message storage](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview): 0.27/GiB-month with first 10GB free (pricing [doc](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/pricing))


### 1.C Bulk data

Bulk data consists of large datasets where ingestion requires high aggregate bandwidth between a small number of sources and the target. The data could be stored in files, such as _CSV_, _JSON_, _Avro_, or _Parquet_ files, or in a _relational_ or _NoSQL_ database. The source data could be located ___on-premises___ or on ___other cloud platforms___.

<ins>Examples</ins>:

- __BigData workloads__: ingestion of a huge JSON file containing all the customer records of a company.
- __Data migration__ to the cloud: Moving data stored in an on-premises Oracle database to a fully managed Cloud SQL database using Informatica.
- __Data Backups__ data from other cloud platforms data: Replication of an AWS bucket store to Google Cloud Storage using [Cloud Storage Transfer Service](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer-service).
- __Importing legacy data__: Copying ten years worth of website log data into BigQuery for long-term trend analysis.

The <ins>Size/Bandwidth tradeoff</ins>: the more the data are bigger, the more the bandwidth you need to get reasonable response times. Both storage volume and bandwidth requirements have to be carefully evaluated as they increase the cost of the cloud solution.

![Size/Bandwidth tradeoff](./imgs/theory/bulk-tradeoff.png)

## STEP 2: Store

Data comes in many different shapes and sizes, and its structure is wholly dependent on the sources from which it was generated and the subsequent downstream use cases. For data and analytics workloads, ingested data can be stored in a variety of formats or locations.

![](./imgs/theory/store.svg)

### 1. Storing object data

<br>

  - conducting complex normalizations or aggregations of that data

In many cases, the data is too large to fit on a single machine. In this situations we can use __FRAMEWORKS__ to ___manage distributed compute clusters___ and to provide software tools that aid ___processing___:
  - [__Dataproc__](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc): a fully-managed service designed for Hadoop or Spark.
      - automated cluster creation
      - simplified cluster configuration and management (installing software, resizing a cluster)
      - built-in monitoring and utilization reports
      - can be shut down when not in use.
  - [__Dataflow__](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow): analyze streaming data to respond in real-time (batch and streaming analytics). It is a managed service where on-demand resources are created, autoscaled, and parallelized.
  - [__Dataprep__](https://cloud.google.com/dataprep): a service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis (you can transform data of any size stored in CSV, JSON, or relational-table formats). It uses Dataflow to scale automatically and can handle terabyte-scale datasets.
